## How to Start
Here is how to run the CIFAR10 example:

#### 1. Server-side execution
This Python module is a client module. The ConLAi service requires the server to be started.  
Docker makes it easy to start a server.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/rosso-ai/conlai:latest
docker run -d -p 9200:9200 ghcr.io/rosso-ai/conlai
```
